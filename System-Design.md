# System Design  

Welcome to the **System Design Repository**! Here, I document my journey through various modules of system design, covering essential principles, design patterns, and complex system architecture concepts. This repository will serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in building a strong foundation in system design, with detailed explanations of design principles, patterns, key system concepts, and real-world design problems.

## Modules Overview

### Module 1: Design Principles
This module introduces fundamental design principles that help build maintainable, scalable, and efficient systems.

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle**: Ensures minimal duplication within code.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principle**: Advocates for simplicity in design to avoid complexity.
- **SOLID Principles**:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle**
  - **Open/Closed Principle**
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle**
  - **Interface Segregation Principle**
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle**
- **CUPID Principles**:
  - **Composability**
  - **Uniformity**
  - **Predictability**
  - **Idempotency**
  - **Discoverability**

### Module 2: Introduction to Design Patterns and Types
In this module, I cover Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) essentials and dive into one of the most common design patterns:

- **OOP Overview**: Key concepts of object-oriented programming that form the foundation for design patterns.
- **The Singleton Pattern**:
  - Part 1: Basics of Singleton Pattern
  - Part 2: Thread-safety in Singleton
  - Part 3: Best practices and use cases

### Module 3: Creational Patterns
This module focuses on patterns that handle object creation in a way that enhances flexibility and reuse.

- **The Factory Pattern**: A method for creating instances without specifying the exact class.
- **The Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the type.
- **The Abstract Factory Pattern**: Creates families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.
- **The Singleton Pattern**: Ensures only one instance of a class is created.
- **The Builder Pattern**: Allows step-by-step construction of complex objects.
- **The Prototype Pattern**: Uses cloning for object creation, avoiding repetitive initialization.
- **Summary of Creational Patterns**: A recap and comparison of each creational pattern.

### Module 4: Structural Patterns
These patterns help compose classes and objects to form larger structures, adding flexibility to system architecture.

---

### Module 5: Behavioral Patterns
This module covers patterns that help manage complex behaviors and communications between objects.

- **The Adapter Pattern**: Converts an interface to a form expected by the client.
- **The Bridge Pattern**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation.
- **The Composite Pattern**: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **The Decorator Pattern**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **The Façade Pattern**: Simplifies interaction with complex systems.
- **The Flyweight Pattern**: Minimizes memory usage by sharing common parts of objects.
- **The Proxy Pattern**: Controls access to objects, adding security and management layers.
- **Summary of Structural Patterns**: A review and analysis of each structural pattern.
